This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

I created this project while following along with this excellent demo from Next Conf 2022

**[Sam Selikoff: Improving developer and user experience with nested layouts in Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mQ3M1CUGnk&list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq&index=7)**

It explores some great features of the [app directory](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13#new-app-directory-beta) made available in [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
